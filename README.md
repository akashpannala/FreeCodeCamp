# FreeCodeCamp: Data Analysis with Python Projects

Hey! This repo is my one-stop hub for the [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/) certification from freeCodeCamp. I got tired of scattered folders messing with my flow (ADHD solidarity), so I bundled 'em here. All Python-powered: pandas for data wrangling, NumPy for math, Matplotlib/Seaborn for plots, and SciPy for the stats heavy lifting.

## Quick Stats
- **Projects**: 5 core challenges
- **Skills**: Data cleaning, stats calcs, visualizations, linear regression
- **Why?**: To predict, analyze, and visualize real-world data like a boss.

## Project Overview
| Project | Description | Key Tools | Link |
|---------|-------------|-----------|------|
| [Demographic Data Analyzer](demographic-data-analyzer/) | Analyzes U.S. census data for mean age, income, and poverty trends by region. | Pandas, NumPy | [Open](demographic-data-analyzer/) |
| [Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator](mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator/) | Builds a stats engine for random variablesâ€”mean, variance, std dev, percentiles. | NumPy, SciPy | [Open](mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator/) |
| [Medical Data Visualizer](medical-data-visualizer/) | Visualizes health costs vs. insurance by region/sex/smoker status with heatmaps and bars. | Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib | [Open](medical-data-visualizer/) |
| [Page View Time Series Visualizer](page-view-time-series-visualizer/) | Forecasts news page views with linear regression and plots trends over time. | Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy | [Open](page-view-time-series-visualizer/) |
| [Sea Level Predictor](sea-level-predictor/) | Models rising sea levels with linear regression and scatter plots future predictions. | Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib | [Open](sea-level-predictor/) |
